#### Day 4/5: Handling Missing Values

This is a fairly large notebook, so please be patient while you go through it.

The topics covered in the notebooks are: Data quality checks, interpolation, univariate & multivariate imputation using scikit-learn and pandas methods (bfill, ffill, mean). There is also a special implementation of MICE, and a self-task to study about KNN imputer.
